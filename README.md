# UFOs

# Purpose:
The purpose of the challenge is to use Javascript to display data collected from multiple UFO sightings in a table and then manipulate the data by applying filters. Additionally, all the information will be put togeter in an html page wich will contain an article, the data that supports the finidings and easy to use filters to tune in into these results.


# Results:

The page that was created has five filters, so people can search by the date, city, state, country or/and the shape of the UFO. The search criteria is very simple and you can perform a search and use any of the filters availabes. 

For example,, you can perform a search by dat by entering the data and pressing enter.

Another example of how we can search is by using combine filter for example by date and shape.

# Summary: 

This page could be poslish to allow for a browder search criteria. For example, allowing the filters to not be case sentsitivy of if they are we can add a note to let peiple know that they have to be precise when filtering otherwise the search will returns no results. This can be solve, by adding a dropdowm menu as well. This page can be a lot of more fun if we make it more interactive and use graphs to show how certain cities have more UFO visiotrs than others, adding a comment seccion for people to leave feeback. These are only a few of the things we can do to make this page beter and fun for people who belive in UFO to follow the page.
